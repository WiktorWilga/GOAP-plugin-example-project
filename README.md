# GOAP Plugin Example Project
This is a sample project demonstrating the use of the plugin for goal-oriented planning.

The project shows sample implementations of all major classes of the plugin such as goals, actions and world state atoms. The project is based on Gameplay Ability System, so you can also see how the plugin is integrated with GAS.
